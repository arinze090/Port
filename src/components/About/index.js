                Conducting user research and interviews, building user flows,
                creating low-fidelity and highfidelity prototypes and managing
                data involved in this process of design are some of my skills.
                For my designs, I utilize Figma and Adobe Photoshop.

                I have a strong track experience of managing and coaching a wide
                range of qualitative and quantitative research projects, and I
                believe this is something I can add to whatever team or office I
                find myself in.

                For my long-term goals in 3-5 years, I hope to be recognized as
                a very resourceful designer. I really want to focus on being a
                strong team player, leading a team that is committed to
                producing excellent design at all costs. I want to work
                somewhere, where I can develop myself and give back to others. I
                believe that my skill set, which includes strong communication
                skills and attention to detail, qualifies me for this role.
